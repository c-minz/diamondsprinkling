MATLAB Source Code for Simulations
==================================

This project contains the source code that is necessary to generate causal sets by sprinkling and analyse their local structure of diamonds.

The source code was developed as part of my PhD project at the Mathematics Department, University of York from 2017 to 2021. The results are published in Physical Review D and can also be found on the arXiv:

Programming language: MATLAB (partially convertable to FreeMat)
Development enviroments: MATLAB R2019a, MATLAB R2020a
Software version on the cluster: MATLAB R2018a
