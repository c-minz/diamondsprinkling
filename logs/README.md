These are examples of log files generated by the scripts

N6000D*.job
to generate job data files "N6000D*biconeJ*.mat" in the directory "data" with a job index after J.

cbN6000D*.job
to combine job data files "N6000D*biconeJ*.mat" to a single result file "N6000D*bicone.mat"

The log files ending in "*.matlab.log" is the redirected output of the MATLAB scripts. The cluster log is contained in the files just ending in "*.job".
